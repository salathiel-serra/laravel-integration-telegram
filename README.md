<h1> LARAVEL INTEGRATION TELEGRAM </h1>

<p>
This is a basic project to study integration between Laravel and the Telegram API, with the purpose of understanding and applying the tools' resources. The Bootstrap CSS Framework was also used.

The Application currently allows sending messages to the BOT on Telegram.
In the future, the option of reading messages in groups via the BOT will be implemented.

See below an image with the application layout:
